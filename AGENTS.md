# Working Style
- Run `cargo test` and `cargo bench` before committing/pushing unless changes are comment-only.
- Keep docs short, clear, and include minimal math when it helps.
- Prefer deterministic, algorithmically generated data in tests and benches.
- Use table/logging helpers for readable iteration output.
